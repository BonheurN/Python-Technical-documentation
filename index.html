          This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is
          not intended as a tutorial.
        </p>

        <p id="first">
          While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English
          rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and
          lexical analysis. This should make the document more understandable to
          the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently,
          if you were coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from
          this document alone, you might have to guess things and in fact you
          would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the
          other hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules
          about a particular area of the language are, you should definitely be
          able to find them here. If you would like to see a more formal
          definition of the language, maybe you could volunteer your time — or
          invent a cloning machine :-).
        </p>

        <p id="second">
          It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language
          reference document — the implementation may change, and other
          implementations of the same language may work differently. On the
          other hand, CPython is the one Python implementation in widespread use
          (although alternate implementations continue to gain support), and its
          particular quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned, especially
          where the implementation imposes additional limitations. Therefore,
          you’ll find short “implementation notes” sprinkled throughout the
          text.
        </p>

        <p id="third">
          Every Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and
          standard modules. These are documented in

          An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports
          several advanced features not found in other implementations like
          stackless support and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the
          project is to encourage experimentation with the language itself by
          making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in
          Python). Additional information is available on

          grammar notation. This uses the following style of definition:
        </p>
        <div id="code">
          <code id="code">
            name ::= lc_letter (lc_letter | "_")*<br />
            lc_letter ::= "a"..."z"
          </code>
        </div>
        <p id="twelfth">
          The first line says that a name is an lc_letter followed by a sequence
          of zero or more lc_letters and underscores. An lc_letter in turn is
          any of the single characters 'a' through 'z'. (This rule is actually
          adhered to for the names defined in lexical and grammar rules in this
          document.)
        </p>
        <p id="thirteenth">
          Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule)
          and<code id="code"> ::= </code>. A vertical bar (|) is used to
          separate alternatives; it is the least binding operator in this
          notation. A star <code id="code">(*)</code> means zero or more
          repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus
          <code id="code">(+)</code> means one or more repetitions, and a phrase
          enclosed in square brackets <code id="code">([ ])</code> means zero or
          one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional). The
          * and + operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are used
          for grouping. Literal strings are enclosed in quotes. White space is
          only meaningful to separate tokens. Rules are normally contained on a
          single line; rules with many alternatives may be formatted
          alternatively with each line after the first beginning with a vertical
          bar.
        </p>

        <p id="fourteenth">
          In lexical definitions (as the example above), two more conventions
          are used: Two literal characters separated by three dots mean a choice
          of any single character in the given (inclusive) range of ASCII
          characters. A phrase between angular brackets
          <code id="code">(<...>)</code> gives an informal description of the
          symbol defined; e.g., this could be used to describe the notion of
          ‘control character’ if needed.
